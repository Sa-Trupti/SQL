SQL stands for Structured Query Language designed to manipulate data in the Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS).

Today, SQL is one of the most common programming languages for interacting with data.
SELECT - extracts data from a database
UPDATE - updates data in a database
DELETE - deletes data from a database
INSERT INTO - inserts new data into a database
CREATE DATABASE - creates a new database
ALTER DATABASE - modifies a database
CREATE TABLE - creates a new table
ALTER TABLE - modifies a table
DROP TABLE - deletes a table
CREATE INDEX - creates an index (search key)
DROP INDEX - deletes an index

For creating a database we have to write the following query.

CREATE DATABASE <databasename>   #Syntax#
CREATE DATABASE data_practice  

For showing the database which we have created and which are present.
show databases;

O/p
# Database
'classicmodels'
'data_parctice'
'information_schema'
'mysql'
'performance_schema'
'sakila'
'sys'
'world'

For using the database which ever we want we have to write the following query.
USE <Database_Name>
USE data_parctice #It will make the given databse as default.
